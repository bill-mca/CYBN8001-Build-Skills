# Skills Work 5

I've attached PDFs for each of the exercises included in this assignment. There are two PDFs derived from markdown and two python notebooks.

Please [view this assignment on Github](https://github.com/bill-mca/CYBN8001-Build-Skills/tree/main/task-5) if it is more convenient for you.

I've also made the Colab notebooks public. [Here's a link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SLb53H9ZnqrDGHSEPkObiWhCaEoqlIdf?usp=sharing) to the decision tree notebook. And [here's a link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VM0LODL_knzCinLPBT0TtBI6WmiWpC7p?usp=sharing) to the fairness in machine learning notebook. 

Best,
Bill
