# Background

## Choice
*Intro to Fairness in ML with TensorFlow (Difficulty: Advanced)*

1. Why did you choose the stretch task? 
2. How is it linked to one or more of the ML skills that you would like to develop?

# Fair Aware Tasks

## Fair Aware Task #1

### Are there missing feature values for a large number of observations?
### Are there features that are missing that might affect other features?
### Are there any unexpected feature values?
### What signs of data skew do you see?

### Reflections on the Hidden Solution

## Fair Aware Task #2

### What's missing?
### What's being overgeneralized?
### What's being underrepresented?
### How do the variables, and their values, reflect the real world?
### What might we be leaving out?

### Reflections on the Hidden Solution

## Fair Aware Task #3

### Chosen Feature
*Which of the following features might pose a problem with regard to fairness?*

### Reflections on the Hidden Solution

## Fair Aware Task #4
### Observations
*Are there any significant disparities in error rates that suggest the model performs better for one subgroup than another?*

### Reflections
*Reflect on the types of bias addressed by the chosen stretch task.*
